      text:
          "Imagine what Manchester United could do if Erik ten Hag hadn’t already lost the dressing room. Yes, it’s been another of those weeks at Old Trafford: rancour, rumour and recrimination, barbs in the press and barbs at the press, defeat at Newcastle followed by this stirring recovery against Chelsea, and the startling realisation that United are now three points behind Manchester City. It’s still only Thursday, by the way.\n\nPerhaps ultimately this win only buys Ten Hag a few days’ grace, a warm flume of goodwill that lasts only as long as it takes for Dominic Solanke to run through on goal for Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon. Back in the grip of crisis, back in the now-familiar lexicon of surly unsourced stories about dressing room discontent. Such is the way of things at football’s most reliable content provider. This beast must always eat.",

      text:
          "In some ways it was a freak. Manchester City won the xG 2.6-0.5. The goal that made it 3-3 was only the second Tottenham’s Dejan Kulusevski has ever scored in his professional career with his head (in reality, his shoulder). City hit the woodwork twice. They might have nicked a very late winner had the referee, Simon Hooper, not blown for a foul on Erling Haaland when Jack Grealish was clean through on goal – a non‑advantage over which Pep Guardiola was commendably restrained in his post-match comments. It was 3-3 but it was a game City had dominated; there really should be nothing for the champions to worry about.\n\nAnd yet, this keeps happening. City have drawn their last three Premier League games. The three equalisers they have conceded came after 95 minutes, after 80 minutes and after 90 minutes. Last Wednesday, they beat RB Leipzig 3-2, but only after going 2-0 down. So much for those who dismiss City’s evident brilliance as risk-free and bloodless.",
